## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on automating SQL queries using **JDBC**. It is based on an existing **MySQL database** containing employee 👩‍💼, department 🏢, salary 💰, and manager 👔 information. Over a one-week sprint 🏃‍♂️, we execute a wide range of tasks on the database and automate these operations using Java and JDBC ☕🔌.


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- ☕ Java (JDK 17+)
- 💾 MySQL Database
- 🔌 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- 🧪 JUnit / Assertions for validation
- 🛠 Maven (Project Management)

## 🧩 Database Schema

This project uses the following tables:
- 👥 `employees`
- 🏬 `departments`
- 👨‍💼 `dept_manager`
- 💵 `salaries`

## 📚 Resources

- 📘 [MySQL Employee Schema Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/sakila-structure.html)
- 🎥 [Techno Study YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Techno_Study)
- 📸 [Techno Study Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/techno.study/)

## 📊 SQL Queries on Employee Database
This project demonstrates 21 useful SQL queries on an employee database, such as salary analysis, department-level summaries, and demographic insights. Great for practicing data retrieval and aggregation skills.

### 📋 Query List (Sprint 1)

1. 📋 List all employees in department `D001`  
2. 🧑‍💼 List all employees in the "Human Resources" department  
3. 💵 Calculate the average salary of all employees  
4. 👨 Calculate the average salary of male employees (`gender = 'M'`)  
5. 👩 Calculate the average salary of female employees (`gender = 'F'`)  
6. 💰 List all employees in the "Sales" department with a salary > 70,000  
7. 🔍 Retrieve employees with salaries between 50,000 and 100,000  
8. 📊 Calculate the average salary for each department (by dept_no or name)  
9. 🏢 Calculate the average salary per department including department names  
10. 🕓 Find all salary changes for employee with `emp_no = '10102'`  
11. 📈 Find salary increases for employee `10102` using `to_date` column  
12. 🏆 Find the employee with the highest salary  
13. 🕒 Find the latest salary for each employee  
14. 🥇 Top-paid employee in the "Sales" department  
15. 🔬 Top average salary in "Research" department  
16. 💼 Highest salary per department  
17. 📈 Highest average salary per department  
18. 📅 Employees hired before Jan 1, 1990  
19. 📅 Employees hired between Jan 1, 1985 and Dec 31, 1989  
20. 💵 "Sales" hires between 1985–1989, sorted by salary  
21. 👥 Employee demographics (counts & distribution)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Each query will be:

- 🔌 Run through JDBC connection
- ✅ Verified using assertions
- 🖥️ Logged to the console
